## Summary

Give a brief explanation of this proposal.

## Basic example

If applicable, give a basic code example of your proposal. If not, omit this session.

## Motivation

Why should we do this? What use cases will it support? What is the expected outcome?

Please explain the motivation such that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the problems you're trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.

## Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for someone familiar with Boa to understand, and for someone familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner cases, and include examples of how the proposed feature may be used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- Implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity
- If adding to the standard library, should it be in there, or could it be a separate library?
- The impact on teaching people Boa
- Cost of migrating existing code (is this a breaking change?)

## Alternatives

What other solutions have been considered? Why this solution rather than them? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

Has anyone else done this before? How did it work out for them? Do any articles exist that discuss this?

Note that precedent alone does not motivate an RFC. We may sometimes diverge from common practices.

Only include this section if applicable.

## Unresolved questions

This section is optional, but highly recommended when applicable.
